The article "Worse is Better" debates two software design philosophies: the "MIT approach" and the "New Jersey approach." The MIT approach aims for perfection in software, emphasizing correctness and completeness. In contrast, the New Jersey approach prioritizes simplicity and practicality over perfection. The title "Worse is Better" means that sometimes, it's better to have something less perfect but practical, as it can spread and improve over time. It's a reminder that in the software world, 'good enough' can often be better than 'perfect' for widespread adoption and success.
